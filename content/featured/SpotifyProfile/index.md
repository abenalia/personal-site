A fully custom-built 6502 computer, inspired by Ben Eaterâ€™s educational series on building an 8-bit breadboard computer. This project explores the fundamentals of CPU architecture, clock cycles, memory addressing, and data flow. Assembled with discrete logic components, it serves as a hands-on learning tool to deepen my understanding of how modern processors operate at the lowest level.
