A custom Arduino-based tire pressure monitoring system using the MPX5700GP analog pressure sensor. Designed to measure and display real-time tire pressure data, this project combines sensor calibration, signal conditioning, and microcontroller programming to deliver accurate readings. A hands-on exploration of embedded systems, sensor interfacing, and automotive applications.
